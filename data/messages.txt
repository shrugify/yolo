And if thou'rt unwilling, then force I'll employ
Because reasons
Because why not?
Big ol' refactoring
Careful! It might open the gates to hell.
Changed everything because I'm bored
Clean up on aisle five
Definitely not the final solution
Don't judge me
Don't tell Dave
Hoping this will fix everything
I can't believe this actually works
I have no idea what I'm doing
It is what it is
Let the games begin
Lets have future me deal with it.
Made a change. Pray for me
Minor changes that no one will notice
Move along there's nothing to see here
Never heard of Composer?
Probably a terrible idea but here goes nothing
Refactored to make it worse
Removed all the code that wasn't working
Removed unused code.
Sauy.
This commit will probably break everything
This could never have worked before
This makes you question your career choices
Update packages
What could possibly go wrong
Works like a charm
[WIP]
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
