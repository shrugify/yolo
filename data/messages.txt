Because reasons
Because why not?
Changed everything because I'm bored
Changed variable names to be more confusing
Code that will make you question your career choices
Committing in the hopes that this will fix everything
Committing my code. Don't judge me
I can't believe this actually works
I have no idea what I'm doing
Made a change. Pray for me
Minor changes that no one will notice
Never heard of Composer?
Refactored to make it worse
Removed all the code that wasn't working
Removed unused code. Finally!
This commit will probably break everything
This is definitely not the final solution
This is probably a terrible idea but here goes nothing
